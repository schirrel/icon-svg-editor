#### Context
First time i did icon to png was in 2017 [here](https://github.com/schirrel/IconToPng) for saving fontawesome or icofont icons to png, latter than i figured out converting SVG was more effective.
I did as a private project for working porpuses, most i used for really.
Now i decided to came back, inprove it a lot and turn it open, for everyone that need to use, use.

Shared, contribute and use as much as you will <3
